## Running with Synthetic Data

### About
This directory contains the implementation of (1) generating random synthetic data for source and target domains and (2) running the aspect-augmented adversarial networks. 

The current implementation can generate four synthetic datasets that represent different challenges in domain adaptation. See [Synthetic Data](#synthetic-data) section for details of the datasets.
